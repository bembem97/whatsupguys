# What are Pseudo-Elements?

A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.

For example, it can be used to:

-   Style the first letter, or line, of an element
-   Insert content before, or after, the content of an element

---

## Syntax

The syntax of pseudo-elements:

```css
selector::pseudo-element {
    property: value;
}
```

---

# The ::first-line Pseudo-element

The `::first-line` pseudo-element is used to add a special style to the first line of a text.

The following example formats the first line of the text in all \<p\> elements:

## Example

```css
p::first-line {
    color: #ff0000;
    font-variant: small-caps;
}
```

**Note:** The `::first-line` pseudo-element can only be applied to block-level elements.

The following properties apply to the `::first-line` pseudo-element:

-   font properties
-   color properties
-   background properties
-   word-spacing
-   letter-spacing
-   text-decoration
-   vertical-align
-   text-transform
-   line-height
-   clear

**Notice the double colon notation -** `::first-line` versus `:first-line`

> The double colon replaced the single-colon notation for pseudo-elements in CSS3. This was an attempt from W3C to distinguish between **pseudo-classes** and **pseudo-elements**.
>
> <br />
> The single-colon syntax was used for both pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements in
> CSS2 and CSS1.
> <br />
> For backward compatibility, the single-colon syntax is acceptable for CSS2 and
> CSS1 pseudo-elements.

<FirstLine />

# The ::first-letter Pseudo-element

The `::first-letter` pseudo-element is used to add a special style to the first letter of a text.

The following example formats the first letter of the text in all \<p\> elements:

## Example

```css
p::first-letter {
    color: #ff0000;
    font-size: xx-large;
}
```

**Note:** The `::first-letter` pseudo-element can only be applied to block-level elements.

The following properties apply to the `::first-letter` pseudo- element:

-   font properties
-   color properties
-   background properties
-   margin properties
-   padding properties
-   border properties
-   text-decoration
-   vertical-align (only if "float" is "none")
-   text-transform
-   line-height
-   float
-   clear

# Pseudo-elements and HTML Classes

Pseudo-elements can be combined with HTML classes:

## Example

```css
p.intro::first-letter {
    color: #ff0000;
    font-size: 200%;
}
```

The example above will display the first letter of paragraphs with `class="intro"`, in red and in a larger size.

---

<FirstLetter />

---

# Multiple Pseudo-elements

Several pseudo-elements can also be combined.

In the following example, the first letter of a paragraph will be red, in an xx-large font size. The rest of the first line will be blue, and in small-caps. The rest of the paragraph will be the default font size and color:

## Example

```css
p::first-letter {
    color: #ff0000;
    font-size: xx-large;
}

p::first-line {
    color: #0000ff;
    font-variant: small-caps;
}
```

<FirstLetterAndLine />

---

# CSS - The ::before Pseudo-element

The `::before` pseudo-element can be used to insert some content before the content of an element.

The following example inserts an image before the content of each \<h1\> element:

## Example

```css
h1::before {
    content: url(smiley.gif);
}
```

---

# CSS - The ::after Pseudo-element

The `::after` pseudo-element can be used to insert some content after the content of an element.

The following example inserts an image after the content of each \<h1\> element:

## Example

```css
h1::after {
    content: url(smiley.gif);
}
```

<PseudoBeforeAfter />

---

# CSS - The ::marker Pseudo-element

The `::marker` pseudo-element selects the markers of list items.

The following example styles the markers of list items:

## Example

```css
::marker {
    color: red;
    font-size: 23px;
}
```

<Marker />

---

# CSS - The ::selection Pseudo-element

The `::selection` pseudo-element matches the portion of an element that is selected by a user.

The following CSS properties can be applied to `::selection:` `color`, `background`, `cursor`, and `outline`.

The following example makes the selected text red on a yellow background:

## Example

```css
::selection {
    color: red;
    background: yellow;
}
```

<Selection />
